    This script is a personal utility written by Jaykstah to automate certain common tasks used with the main workstation setup.
    This utility is mainly used as a hub to execute other, independent scripts with their own functions.
    These functions range from audio system configuration, hardware profiles, peripheral configuration, themeing, and more.
    
    Some scripts to require sudo permissions. These are texted explicitly on Jaykstah's system and may cause damage if used on a foreign system.
    If you wish to use this utility, or modify it for use, on your own system, I recommend reading through each script that you may used
    in order to modify it for correct compatibility with your system.
    Also, it may be wise to remove menu entries for scripts you will not make use of, to avoid errant keypresses.
    
    I have made an effort to put ample warning and pauses for user input whenever a script may require sudo permission.
    Keep in mind most of these scripts are used on a daily basis, so not a lot of precaution has been taken as they are 
    tried and true on my system.
    
    Also, these scripts are structured from the perspective of an Arch Linux install, and may misbehave on other distros.
    Pay attention to how commands are being used and modify them if there is a better method to call the same functions 
    for your particular distro.
    
    Jaykstah is not responsible for any damage done to your Linux installation due to flippant use of this utility.
    Again, it is configured specifically for one workstation setup.
    
    Current configuration is expecting a 4 core/4 thread Intel processor (namely i5 6600k) which is non hyperthreaded
    as well as an Nvidia 10 series GPU (namely a GTX 1070) using the latest proprietary drivers.
    
    Some calls will also assume that certain libraries are installed, which may not be by default on your distro.
    These scripts are not designed explicitly to point out missing, required software, so if a command fails you
    may need to investigate and install the missing software packages and kernel modules needed.
    
    Some scripts also assume naming conventions based on Jaykstah's workstation. Configuration involving peripherals
    may not be configured in a "smart" way and refer to ID's expected by xinput on Jaykstah's system.
    There is work being done to improve the scripts and add the ability for them to locate devices by name,
    but they are largely still reliant on an expected configuration of hardware and xinput naming schemes.
    
    These scripts are using commands which assume the workstation is using the systemd init system, the X display server,
    and will be interpreted through a bash shell.
