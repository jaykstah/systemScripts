    These scripts are a collection of tools I've written for my own workflow and system configuration.
    The menu.sh script is a hub to access all of the functions.
    This script will not pull dependencies for these functions but I'll make an effort to describe what uncommon packages are needed, if any, next to each menu entry.

    I've written these scripts for my personal Arch system so some tools will rely on pacman or other Arch-isms. Currently most tools rely on a somewhat hardcoded layout that is specific to my system, so not all tools will work for others and may break your configs!
    I'm planning to overhaul some of these scripts to make them a bit smarter and more adaptable to different environments.

    I'm by no means a shell scripting expert, so suggestions are appreciated if you can see easy ways to improve how they work without adding unnecessary features.

    Overall these scripts can be described as utilities for system maintenence & customization to compliment my Arch + sway setup and make things easier to manage.

    Below I'll catalogue my system to show what I'm using. Some scripts are reliant on this setup and will not work properly if alternatives are used.

Init: systemd *1
Package manager: pacman
Window Manager: sway
Audio backend: PipeWire *2
Shell: bash *3

*1: Some scripts rely on systemd related commands to get info about the user's session or to prompt a logout
*2: I am currently using PipeWire but some scripts still use PulseAudio commands and may work fine under PulseAudio
*3: All scripts have a shebang to be interpreted by bash. As long as bash is installed they should work regardless of the interactive shell you use.
